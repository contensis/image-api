# Image API

Image transformations are real-time image manipulation and optimization features of the Delivery API that speeds up image delivery. As Contensis caches the results of image transformations, you can retrieve the adjusted images even faster the next time you need them.

By adding parameters to your image URL, you can enhance, resize and crop images, compress them, or change the format for better performance. These operations can be applied programmatically in real time, removing the need to batch process or maintain multiple copies of an image to match the viewport of different devices.
