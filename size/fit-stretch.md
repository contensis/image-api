description: The fit stretch property allows and image to be resized to meet the exact dimensions you specify but will result in the image being stretched.

# Fit stretch

When the `fit=stretch` parameter is used in conjunction with the `width` and `height` parameters, then the image will be stretched to fit the dimensions exactly. The resulting image will fill the dimensions, and will not maintain the aspect ratio of the input image.
