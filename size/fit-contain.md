# Fit contain

When the `fit=contain` parameter is used in conjunction with the `width` and `height` parameters then the image will be scaled to fit within the width / height boundaries without cropping, distorting or altering the aspect ratio. The resulting image will increase the size of the image if it is smaller than the output size.
